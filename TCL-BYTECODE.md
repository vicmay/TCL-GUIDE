# Disassemble a simple procedure
puts [tcl::unsupported::disassemble {

}]

#### Interpreting `disassemble` Output

The output from `tcl::unsupported::disassemble` provides a wealth of information. Here's a breakdown of some common fields you'll encounter:

*   **`ByteCode 0x...`**: The memory address of the bytecode object.
*   **`Source "..."`**: The original Tcl source code snippet that was compiled.
*   **`Cmds <N>`**: The number of distinct Tcl command structures compiled within this bytecode object. A single line of Tcl might involve multiple "commands" in the Tcl parser's sense (e.g., an `if` command contains sub-commands for its condition and branches).
*   **`src <N>`**: The total length in characters of the original Tcl source code.
*   **`inst <N>`**: The total number of bytecode instructions generated.
*   **`litObjs <N>`**: The number of literal objects (constants) stored in the bytecode object's constant pool.
*   **`stkDepth <N>`**: The maximum depth the execution stack is expected to reach during the execution of this bytecode. This is crucial for the Tcl VM to allocate sufficient stack space.
*   **`code/src <N.NN>`**: A ratio indicating the density of bytecode instructions relative to the source code length. This is an internal metric and not typically used for direct analysis.
*   **`Commands <N>:`**: Marks the beginning of the detailed breakdown for each command structure.
    *   **`X: pc Y-Z, src A-B`**: This line maps a specific command structure (indexed by `X`) to a range of program counter values (`pc Y-Z`) in the bytecode instruction stream and the corresponding character range (`src A-B`) in the original source code. This is invaluable for correlating bytecode back to the source.
*   **`Command X: "..."`**: Shows the source code for the specific Tcl command being detailed.
*   **`(O) opcode operands  # "comment"`**: This is the core instruction listing.
    *   `(O)`: The byte offset (program counter, pc) of this instruction from the beginning of the current command's bytecode.
    *   `opcode`: The name of the bytecode instruction.
    *   `operands`: Any operands the instruction takes (e.g., constant index, jump offset, variable slot).
    *   `# "comment"`: The disassembler often adds a comment, frequently showing the actual value of a constant being pushed or the name of a variable being accessed.

Understanding these fields will help you make sense of the bytecode examples presented later and when you disassemble your own Tcl code.

### Common Patterns

### Operand Type Notation Recap

*   `uint1`: 1-byte unsigned integer (e.g., for small constant indices, counts).
*   `uint4`: 4-byte unsigned integer (e.g., for large constant indices).
*   `int1`: 1-byte signed integer (e.g., for short relative jumps).
*   `int4`: 4-byte signed integer (e.g., for long relative jumps).
*   `%v<n>`: A virtual register for a local variable slot (e.g., `%v0`).

### Control Flow

Jump offsets are relative to the program counter *after* the jump instruction itself.

| Opcode       | Operands      | Description                                                               | Example                |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `jump`       | `int1` / `int4` | Unconditional jump. Suffix `1` or `4` indicates offset size. Example shows generic name. | `jump +10`             |
| `jump1`      | `int1`        | Unconditional jump (1-byte signed offset)                                 | `jump1 +10`            |
| `jump4`      | `int4`        | Unconditional jump (4-byte signed offset)                                 | `jump4 -200`           |
| `jumpTrue`   | `int1` / `int4` | Pop stack; if true (non-zero, not "false", etc.), jump. Suffix `1` or `4`. | `jumpTrue +5`          |
| `jumpTrue1`  | `int1`        | Pop stack; if true, jump (1-byte offset)                                  | `jumpTrue1 +5`         |
| `jumpTrue4`  | `int4`        | Pop stack; if true, jump (4-byte offset)                                  | `jumpTrue4 +100`       |
| `jumpFalse`  | `int1` / `int4` | Pop stack; if false (zero, "false", etc.), jump. Suffix `1` or `4`.    | `jumpFalse +5`         |
| `jumpFalse1` | `int1`        | Pop stack; if false, jump (1-byte offset)                                 | `jumpFalse1 +8`        |
| `jumpFalse4` | `int4`        | Pop stack; if false, jump (4-byte offset)                                 | `jumpFalse4 -50`       |
| `invokeStk`  | `uint1`       | Call Tcl command. Operand is number of arguments on stack. The command name itself must have been pushed prior. | `invokeStk 2` (2 args) |
| `invokeStk0` | -             | Call Tcl command with 0 arguments from stack. (Specific to Tcl versions or a common case optimization) | `invokeStk0`           |
| `invokeStk1` | `uint1`       | Call Tcl command. Operand is number of arguments on stack. (This seems to be the common form in examples, check if `1` is part of name or if `invokeStk` is generic) | `invokeStk1 2`         |
| `return`     | -             | Return from procedure. Top of stack is the result.                        | `return`               |
| `done`       | -             | Marks the end of the bytecode sequence for the current script/command.      | `done`                 |
| `nop`        | -             | No operation. Sometimes used for padding or by the compiler.               | `nop`                  |


#### Clarifying `invokeStk`

The `invokeStk` family of instructions is used to call Tcl commands (including procedures).
1.  The name of the command to be invoked must be pushed onto the stack first.
2.  Then, all arguments for the command must be pushed onto the stack in order.
3.  Finally, an `invokeStk` instruction is executed. The operand to `invokeStk` (e.g., `invokeStk <count>`) specifies the number of arguments that have been pushed onto the stack for that command.
    *   `invokeStk1 <count>`: This form, often seen in `disassemble` output, seems to indicate that the `1` might be part of the opcode name related to how results are handled or stack is managed. The `<count>` is the number of arguments.
    *   `invokeStk0`: A specialized version for invoking a command with zero arguments, potentially for efficiency.
    *   The general principle is: `push <command_name>`, `push <arg1>`, ..., `push <argN>`, `invokeStk N`.
    The value returned by the invoked command will be left on the top of the stack.


### String Operations

| Opcode     | Operands     | Description                                             | Example                 |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `strcat`   | `uint1`      | Concatenate top N strings from stack, push result. N is operand. | `strcat 3` (3 items)  |
| `strcmp`   | -            | Compare top two strings, push integer result (<0, 0, >0) | `strcmp`                |
| `strlen`   | -            | Get length of top string, push result                   | `strlen`                |
| `strindex` | -            | Top stack: index, Second: string. Push char at index.    | `strindex`              |
| `strrange` | -            | Top: last_idx, Second: first_idx, Third: string. Push substring. | `strrange`              |

## Bytecode Examples

Cmds 1, src 24, inst 10, litObjs 1, aux 0, stkDepth 2, code/src 0.00
  Commands 1:
      1: pc 0-8, src 0-23
  Command 1: "set x [expr {10 + 20}]"
    (0) push1 0     # "10"
    (2) push1 1     # "20"
    (4) add 
    (5) store %v0   # var "x"
    (7) push1 2     # ""
    (9) done 

The `push1 2 # ""` instruction at the end pushes an empty string, which becomes the result of the `set` command (and thus the overall script if it's the last command). Local variable `%v0` is implicitly assigned to "x" by the compiler in this context of a simple `set`.

### If-Else Statement

Cmds 2, src 40, inst 18, litObjs 1, aux 0, stkDepth 2, code/src 0.00
  Commands 2:
      1: pc 0-18, src 0-39
  Command 1: "if {$x > 0} {\n    set result \"Positive\"\n} else {\n    set result \"Non-positive\"\n}"
    (0) load %v0    # var "x"
    (2) push1 0     # "0"
    (4) gt 
    (5) jumpFalse1 +9  # pc 14
  Command 2: "set result \"Positive""
    (19) invokeStk1 2 
    (21) jump1 -18  # pc 4
    (23) push1 4    # ""
    (25) done 

The `invokeStk1 2` calls `puts`. The arguments pushed are "i = " (from constant pool) and the current value of `i` (loaded from `%v0`). The `2` indicates two arguments. The `jump1 -18` is a relative jump back to the loop condition check (`load %v0` at pc 4).

## Working with Bytecode 

## Bytecode Basics

### Bytecode Structure

TCL bytecode consists of several interconnected parts that define a compiled script or procedure:

*   **Header**: Contains metadata about the bytecode object itself, such as its type, size, and references to other components like the instruction stream and constant pool.
*   **Instruction Stream**: A sequence of opcodes and their operands that define the actual operations to be performed by the Tcl Virtual Machine (TVM).
*   **Constant Pool**: An array of literal values (strings, numbers, compiled script fragments) used by the instructions. Instructions reference these by an index.
*   **Local Variables Table**: Defines the number and names (for debugging) of local variables used by the procedure. These are accessed as virtual registers (e.g., `%v0`).
*   **Exception Ranges**: Specifies ranges of bytecode instructions that are covered by Tcl's error handling mechanisms (like `catch` or `try`). If an error occurs within such a range, control can be transferred to a specific handler. This allows for efficient, low-level error management.
*   **Auxiliary Data**: May include other information, such as source code line number mappings to bytecode instructions, which is vital for debugging.

Here's a conceptual diagram of how these parts relate:

```
+-------------------------+
|    Bytecode Object      |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Header Information  | | 
| +---------------------+ |
| | Instruction Stream  | | ----> [opcode, operand, ...]
| | (Sequence of bytes) | |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Constant Pool       | | ----> [const0, const1, ...]
| | (Array of Tcl_Obj)  | |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Local Variables     | | ----> [name0, name1, ...]
| +---------------------+ |
| | Exception Ranges    | | ----> [range0_start, range0_end, range0_handler_pc, ...]
| +---------------------+ |
| | Auxiliary Data      | | ----> [line_num_map, ...]
| +---------------------+ |
+-------------------------+
```

### Viewing Bytecode

# Create the procedure
proc double x [list bytecode [tcl::unsupported::assemble $bytecode]]

# Test it
puts [double 5]  ;# Outputs: 10

#### Visualizing Stack Operations (Conceptual Example)

Let's trace the stack for a simple expression like `expr { (5 + 3) * 2 }`. The conceptual bytecode might be:

1.  `push1 <idx_for_5>`   ; Push 5
2.  `push1 <idx_for_3>`   ; Push 3
3.  `add`                 ; Add them
4.  `push1 <idx_for_2>`   ; Push 2
5.  `mult`                ; Multiply

Here's how the stack evolves:

| Step        | Instruction         | Stack (Top ->)      | Comment                       |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Initial     |                     | `[empty]`           |                               |
| 1           | `push1 <idx_for_5>` | `[5]`               | 5 is pushed                   |
| 2           | `push1 <idx_for_3>` | `[3, 5]`            | 3 is pushed                   |
| 3           | `add`               | `[8]`               | 3 and 5 popped, 8 pushed      |
| 4           | `push1 <idx_for_2>` | `[2, 8]`            | 2 is pushed                   |
| 5           | `mult`              | `[16]`              | 2 and 8 popped, 16 pushed     |

The final result, 16, is left on the stack.

### Bytecode Optimization

TCL performs several optimizations when generating bytecode to improve execution speed and reduce memory usage. Understanding these can help in writing Tcl code that compiles efficiently. Some key optimizations include:

1.  **Constant Folding**:
    *   **Description**: Expressions involving only constants are evaluated at compile time.
    *   **Tcl Code**: `set x [expr {10 + 20 * 2}]`
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual)**: Instead of instructions for `push 20`, `push 2`, `mult`, `push 10`, `add`, the compiler might directly generate `push1 <idx_for_50>` (where 50 is the folded constant).
    *   **Benefit**: Reduces runtime calculations.

2.  **Dead Code Elimination**:
    *   **Description**: Code that can never be reached is removed.
    *   **Tcl Code**:
        ```tcl
        set a 1
        if {0} {
            # This block is dead code
            puts "Never printed"
        }
        return $a
        ```
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual)**: The instructions for the `puts` command within the `if {0}` block would likely be omitted entirely from the generated bytecode for that conditional branch.
    *   **Benefit**: Reduces bytecode size and avoids executing unnecessary logic.

3.  **Inlining of Simple Procedures (Limited)**:
    *   **Description**: For very simple, small Tcl procedures, the Tcl compiler might replace a call to the procedure with the bytecode of the procedure itself. This is less common or aggressive in Tcl compared to some other compiled languages but can occur for internal or built-in commands.
    *   **Tcl Code**: `proc add_one {x} {return [expr {$x + 1}]}; set y [add_one 5]`
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual)**: In some specific optimized cases (often for internal C-level commands rather than user procs directly), a call like `add_one 5` might be replaced by bytecode equivalent to `push 5`, `push 1`, `add` directly at the call site, avoiding the overhead of a procedure call (`invokeStk`). For user-defined Tcl procs, this is rare; usually `invokeStk` is used.
    *   **Benefit**: Reduces procedure call overhead for trivial operations.

4.  **Common Subexpression Elimination (Limited)**:
    *   **Description**: If the same subexpression is calculated multiple times and its value doesn't change, the compiler might compute it once and reuse the result. Tcl's dynamic nature makes this challenging for general Tcl code but can apply in `expr` contexts.
    *   **Tcl Code**: `set z [expr {($a * $b) + ($a * $b)}]`
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual for `expr`)**: The subexpression `$a * $b` might be computed once, its result stored temporarily (e.g., on stack or a virtual register), and then reused for the second part of the addition, rather than two separate sequences of `load a, load b, mult`.
    *   **Benefit**: Avoids redundant computations.

These optimizations are generally handled by the Tcl compiler (`tcl::unsupported::compile`) automatically. While direct bytecode manipulation can achieve further specific optimizations, it requires deep understanding and care.

#### Step-by-Step Walkthrough: `fact 3` (Conceptual)

Let's trace the execution of `fact 3` with the bytecode above. We'll simplify and focus on key stack/variable states. Assume constants are: `0: 1`, `1: "fact"`.

**Call 1: `fact(3)`** (`%v0` = 3)

| PC | Instruction      | Stack (Top ->)           | `%v0` (n) | Comments                                            |
|----|------------------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | `load %v0`       | `[3]`                    | 3         | Load n (3)                                          |
| 1  | `push1 0`        | `[1, 3]`                 | 3         | Push constant 1                                     |
| 2  | `le`             | `[0]`                    | 3         | 3 <= 1 is false (0)                                 |
| 3  | `jumpFalse1 +10` | `[]`                     | 3         | Condition false, jump to recursive case (pc 13)     |
|    | ...              |                          |           |                                                     |

### Debugging TCL Bytecode

3. **Array Element Access (Conceptual)**:
   Accessing an array element like `set x $myarray(key)` involves:
   ```tcl
   # Tcl: set x $myarray(key)
   # Conceptual Bytecode:
   push1 <idx_for_"myarray(key)">  # Push the full variable name including key
   evalStk                        # Evaluate to get the variable's value (or similar specialized var access opcode)
   store %v0                      # Store in x (assuming x is %v0)
   # OR, if direct array opcodes are used:
   push1 <idx_for_"myarray">       # Push array name
   push1 <idx_for_"key">         # Push key
   arrayGetStk                    # Get array element (specialized opcode)
   store %v0                      # Store in x
   ```
   The exact opcodes can vary based on Tcl version and specific optimizations for variable access.
   The `disassemble` output is the best guide for actual generated code.

## Bytecode Basics

### Bytecode Structure

TCL bytecode consists of several interconnected parts that define a compiled script or procedure:

*   **Header**: Contains metadata about the bytecode object itself, such as its type, size, and references to other components like the instruction stream and constant pool.
*   **Instruction Stream**: A sequence of opcodes and their operands that define the actual operations to be performed by the Tcl Virtual Machine (TVM).
*   **Constant Pool**: An array of literal values (strings, numbers, compiled script fragments) used by the instructions. Instructions reference these by an index.
*   **Local Variables Table**: Defines the number and names (for debugging) of local variables used by the procedure. These are accessed as virtual registers (e.g., `%v0`).
*   **Exception Ranges**: Specifies ranges of bytecode instructions that are covered by Tcl's error handling mechanisms (like `catch` or `try`). If an error occurs within such a range, control can be transferred to a specific handler. This allows for efficient, low-level error management.
*   **Auxiliary Data**: May include other information, such as source code line number mappings to bytecode instructions, which is vital for debugging.

Here's a conceptual diagram of how these parts relate:

```
+-------------------------+
|    Bytecode Object      |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Header Information  | | 
| +---------------------+ |
| | Instruction Stream  | | ----> [opcode, operand, ...]
| | (Sequence of bytes) | |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Constant Pool       | | ----> [const0, const1, ...]
| | (Array of Tcl_Obj)  | |
| +---------------------+ |
| | Local Variables     | | ----> [name0, name1, ...]
| +---------------------+ |
| | Exception Ranges    | | ----> [range0_start, range0_end, range0_handler_pc, ...]
| +---------------------+ |
| | Auxiliary Data      | | ----> [line_num_map, ...]
| +---------------------+ |
+-------------------------+
```

### Viewing Bytecode

# Create the procedure
proc double x [list bytecode [tcl::unsupported::assemble $bytecode]]

# Test it
puts [double 5]  ;# Outputs: 10

#### Visualizing Stack Operations (Conceptual Example)

Let's trace the stack for a simple expression like `expr { (5 + 3) * 2 }`. The conceptual bytecode might be:

1.  `push1 <idx_for_5>`   ; Push 5
2.  `push1 <idx_for_3>`   ; Push 3
3.  `add`                 ; Add them
4.  `push1 <idx_for_2>`   ; Push 2
5.  `mult`                ; Multiply

Here's how the stack evolves:

| Step        | Instruction         | Stack (Top ->)      | Comment                       |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Initial     |                     | `[empty]`           |                               |
| 1           | `push1 <idx_for_5>` | `[5]`               | 5 is pushed                   |
| 2           | `push1 <idx_for_3>` | `[3, 5]`            | 3 is pushed                   |
| 3           | `add`               | `[8]`               | 3 and 5 popped, 8 pushed      |
| 4           | `push1 <idx_for_2>` | `[2, 8]`            | 2 is pushed                   |
| 5           | `mult`              | `[16]`              | 2 and 8 popped, 16 pushed     |

The final result, 16, is left on the stack.

### Bytecode Optimization

TCL performs several optimizations when generating bytecode to improve execution speed and reduce memory usage. Understanding these can help in writing Tcl code that compiles efficiently. Some key optimizations include:

1.  **Constant Folding**:
    *   **Description**: Expressions involving only constants are evaluated at compile time.
    *   **Tcl Code**: `set x [expr {10 + 20 * 2}]`
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual)**: Instead of instructions for `push 20`, `push 2`, `mult`, `push 10`, `add`, the compiler might directly generate `push1 <idx_for_50>` (where 50 is the folded constant).
    *   **Benefit**: Reduces runtime calculations.

2.  **Dead Code Elimination**:
    *   **Description**: Code that can never be reached is removed.
    *   **Tcl Code**:
        ```tcl
        set a 1
        if {0} {
            # This block is dead code
            puts "Never printed"
        }
        return $a
        ```
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual)**: The instructions for the `puts` command within the `if {0}` block would likely be omitted entirely from the generated bytecode for that conditional branch.
    *   **Benefit**: Reduces bytecode size and avoids executing unnecessary logic.

3.  **Inlining of Simple Procedures (Limited)**:
    *   **Description**: For very simple, small Tcl procedures, the Tcl compiler might replace a call to the procedure with the bytecode of the procedure itself. This is less common or aggressive in Tcl compared to some other compiled languages but can occur for internal or built-in commands.
    *   **Tcl Code**: `proc add_one {x} {return [expr {$x + 1}]}; set y [add_one 5]`
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual)**: In some specific optimized cases (often for internal C-level commands rather than user procs directly), a call like `add_one 5` might be replaced by bytecode equivalent to `push 5`, `push 1`, `add` directly at the call site, avoiding the overhead of a procedure call (`invokeStk`). For user-defined Tcl procs, this is rare; usually `invokeStk` is used.
    *   **Benefit**: Reduces procedure call overhead for trivial operations.

4.  **Common Subexpression Elimination (Limited)**:
    *   **Description**: If the same subexpression is calculated multiple times and its value doesn't change, the compiler might compute it once and reuse the result. Tcl's dynamic nature makes this challenging for general Tcl code but can apply in `expr` contexts.
    *   **Tcl Code**: `set z [expr {($a * $b) + ($a * $b)}]`
    *   **Bytecode (Conceptual for `expr`)**: The subexpression `$a * $b` might be computed once, its result stored temporarily (e.g., on stack or a virtual register), and then reused for the second part of the addition, rather than two separate sequences of `load a, load b, mult`.
    *   **Benefit**: Avoids redundant computations.

These optimizations are generally handled by the Tcl compiler (`tcl::unsupported::compile`) automatically. While direct bytecode manipulation can achieve further specific optimizations, it requires deep understanding and care.
